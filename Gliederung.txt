1. Introduction
    1.1 Motivation    milestone at that time / groundwork for other real-time object detection procedures such as SURF (Speedup ... references)
    1.2 Usage	- Object recognitzion, panorama stitching, Gesture Recognition, Object tracking in Videos
    1.3 Stable and recognizable image features          feature selection (more invariance --> more robust/stable)

2. Extracting SIFT-Features
        (1.2)?? "It seems that Lowe initially developed SIFT for the use of object recognition since he dedicates a fair amount of his paper on how to acomplish this task using SIFT-Features. However they can also be used for all kinds of tasks relevant in numerus computer vision applications. The fact?! that these descriptors are invariant to scale and rotation and quite robust to settle changes in illumination, noise, partial occlusion and distortion makes them a good fit for object tracking in videos or stiching single images together into a panoramic image (references!!)"
    2.1 Selecting Keypoints from Scale-Space Extrema
        "...
        Subtracting 2 different strongly smoothed variants of the same image and only considering keypoints that  garantiees that roughly the same features will be extracted from an object not matter how large it is depicted in an image. Therfore these features (represented by each keypoint) are considered to be invariant to scale"

    2.2 Keypoint refinement

    2.3 Keypoint filtering 
    	- localizable corners along an edge, Harris corner detector/Matrix
    2.4 Orientation assignment
        - most dominant gradient 
    2.5 Constructing feature descriptors
    	- 128-dim descriptor
    	- what is recorded?
    	- how is it constructed?


3. Feature matching
    - The SIFT-feature invariance and robustness to many 'image properties'?! ensure that many corresponding features of the same object can be found in different images even under .. conditions
    "However this procedure is not perfect. repetitive structures... detecting outliers is essential for further processing 
    Furthermore its lack of speed --> SURF

4. Conclusion
